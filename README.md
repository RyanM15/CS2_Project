# CS2_Project
- write code that assists MLB scouts and can compare potential prospects with current MLB players. It will take stats of the prospect and compare them with the average of an MLB player at the same position, use MLB API
- March 30 log -- began to learn and research how to use an MLB API and how to convert into a program, thought about other ways to use the data to compare with avg stats of players
- April 5 log -- researched different ways to put in stats not using API, looked at hardcoding the average stats into the program rather than pulling individual stats from an API. Thinking for position players I could use batting average, ops, obp, fielding percentage, might add more later
