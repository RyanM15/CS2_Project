# CS2_Project
- March 10 log -- started this project, my idea so far --> write code that assists MLB scouts and can compare potential prospects with current MLB players. It will take stats of the prospect and compare them with the average of an MLB player at the same position, use MLB API

- March 30 log -- began to learn and research how to use an MLB API and how to convert into a program, thought about other ways to use the data to compare with avg stats of players

- April 5 log -- researched different ways to put in stats not using API, looked at hardcoding the average stats into the program rather than pulling individual stats from an API. Thinking for position players I could use batting average, ops, obp, fielding percentage, might add more later

- April 7 log -- settled on four stats for postion players (infield outfield) and pitchers. Thinking might just do these two and hardcode my own stats that I find and compile because API has individual players but I need average at a postion. I havent been able to find averages for average player only the best or worst, this may cause me to change to a different scale of measuring skill
 
- April 9 log -- began writing my code today. Just began getting my code to accept a position from the user and trying to seperate getting stats for position player rather than pitcher and getting the seperate stats for the pitcher. Trying to figure out how I can use multiple stingcomps for one argument.

- April 13 log -- kept writing the actaul code, hardcoded stats

- April 19 log -- finished harcoding the stats, put in how to grade if all stats are greater than hall of fame average it gives player a rate of 8 (the best)
